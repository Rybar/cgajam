CGA Jam
theme: gravity/faster faster

tempest / gyruss style shooter + infinite run/dodge mashup
with scaling sprites! maybe voxels?

idea:

player moves around the perimeter, tempest/gyruss style, shooting baddies that come from the center. Also dodging towers/driving/collecting things.

logically, this is just a top down shooter with world-wrap.

visually, we're going to wrap it around a circle. and do some fun faux-3d stuff.

implement theme: world wizzes by faster and faster

MVP:

features, prioritized:

player movement around a circle

enemies
